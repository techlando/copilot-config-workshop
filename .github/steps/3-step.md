## Step 3: Path-Specific Instructions - Build a Developer Agent

_SDLC Phase: **Implementation**_

> **Why this matters:** During Implementation, different parts of the codebase serve different purposes and follow different rules. Models handle data validation, services manage business logic, and utilities provide shared helpers. Path-specific instructions let you give Copilot the right guidance for each area automatically.

Your Architect Agent produced a schema and file structure. Now you turn that design into working code. In this step, you create [path-specific instruction files](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/customizing-copilot/adding-repository-custom-instructions-for-github-copilot) that give Copilot different coding conventions for different parts of the codebase, then build a **Developer Agent** that generates the implementation.

### 📖 Theory: How path-specific instructions work

Path-specific instruction files live in `.github/instructions/` and use the `.instructions.md` suffix. A YAML front matter block (the configuration header at the top of the file) specifies which files trigger them via `applyTo`.

When Copilot works on a matching file, it combines:

1. The repository-wide instructions from `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
1. All matching path-specific instructions

Both sets are active at the same time. This lets you define general project conventions once and add targeted rules for specific directories.

```yaml
---
applyTo: "src/models/**"
---
```

> **What is a glob pattern?** The `applyTo` value uses a glob pattern, a shorthand for matching file paths. `src/models/**` means "all files inside the `src/models/` folder and its subfolders." The `**` wildcard matches any number of folders deep.

## ⌨️ Activity: Create path-specific instruction files

1. In the VS Code Explorer sidebar, right-click the `.github` folder and select **New Folder**. Name it `instructions`.

1. Right-click the new `.github/instructions` folder and select **New File**. Name it `models.instructions.md`. Paste the following content:

    ```markdown
    ---
    applyTo: "src/models/**"
    ---

    # Model File Instructions

    - Export a single class per file.
    - Validate all constructor arguments. Throw a `TypeError` with a
      descriptive message for invalid inputs.
    - Include a `toJSON()` method that returns a plain object.
    - Generate unique IDs using `crypto.randomUUID()`.
    - Add JSDoc comments to the class and every public method.
    ```

1. Right-click `.github/instructions` again, select **New File**, and name it `services.instructions.md`. Paste the following content:

    ```markdown
    ---
    applyTo: "src/services/**"
    ---

    # Service File Instructions

    - Export functions, not classes.
    - Every function that modifies data must return the modified object.
    - Return copies of data, never direct references to internal state.
    - Throw descriptive errors for "not found" and "invalid input" cases.
    - Keep functions small. Each function handles one operation.
    ```

1. Right-click `.github/instructions` again, select **New File**, and name it `utils.instructions.md`. Paste the following content:

    ```markdown
    ---
    applyTo: "src/utils/**"
    ---

    # Utility File Instructions

    - Export pure functions only. No side effects.
    - Every function must validate its inputs and throw a `TypeError`
      for invalid arguments.
    - Include at least two usage examples in each JSDoc comment.
    ```

    > 💡 **Tip:** In Codespaces, files save automatically. If you are working locally, save with `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`.

## ⌨️ Activity: Create the Developer Agent

1. Create a new file at `.github/agents/developer.agent.md`:

    ```markdown
    ---
    name: developer
    description: Reads a schema document and generates implementation code following path-specific conventions
    handoffs: 
    - agent: tester
      label: "Test the feature"
      prompt: "Read the updated source files in src/ and update tests/ to cover the new feature. Run node --test tests/ and fix any failures."
      send: false
    ---

    You are a software developer. Given a data schema and file structure
    document, you generate working implementation code.

    ## Process

    1. Read the schema document the user provides.
    2. Create each file described in the schema's file structure.
    3. Follow the conventions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
       and any matching path-specific instruction files in
       `.github/instructions/`.
    4. After generating all files, run the entry point with Node.js
       to verify there are no syntax or runtime errors.
    5. Fix any errors and re-run until the code executes without issues.

    ## Rules

    - Use only built-in Node.js modules.
    - Place source files under `src/` following the structure in the schema.
    - Every file must use ES module syntax (`import`/`export`).
    - Add `console.log` calls in the entry point to demonstrate each feature.
    ```

    > 💡 **Tip:** In Codespaces, files save automatically. If you are working locally, save with `Ctrl+S` / `Cmd+S`.

    > ⚠️ **Expected warning:** VS Code may show a validation warning that the `tester` agent referenced in `handoffs` does not exist yet. This is expected — you will create the Tester Agent in Step 4. The handoff will work once all agents are in place. You will use these handoffs in the final exercise (Step 7) to chain all agents together.

## ⌨️ Activity: Use the Developer Agent to implement the Task Manager

1. In Copilot Chat, select **developer** from the agent dropdown.

1. Type:

    ```
    Read #file:docs/schema.md and implement the Task Manager application.

    Create these files:
    1. src/models/task.js - Task class with validation
    2. src/services/taskService.js - CRUD operations for tasks
    3. src/utils/validators.js - input validation helpers
    4. src/index.js - entry point that demonstrates all features

    After creating all files, run src/index.js with Node.js and fix
    any errors.
    ```

1. Approve each file creation when prompted. Watch the agent run the code and iterate on errors.

1. When the agent finishes, verify the output:

    ```bash
    node src/index.js
    ```

## ⌨️ Activity: Commit and push your work

1. In the VS Code left sidebar, click the **Source Control** tab.

1. Hover over each changed file and click the **+** (Stage Changes) button, or click the **+** next to **Changes** to stage everything.

    <img width="300" alt="Screenshot: Stage changes icon in VS Code Source Control" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/skills/getting-started-with-github-copilot/main/.github/images/staging-changes-icon.png" />

1. In the **Message** text box, type:

    ```
    Add path-specific instructions and Developer Agent with implementation
    ```

1. Click **Commit**, then click **Sync Changes** to push to GitHub.

1. After you push, the workflow checks your work and posts the next step.

<summary>Having trouble? 🤷</summary><br/>

- Confirm instruction files are inside `.github/instructions/` and end with `.instructions.md`.
- The YAML front matter must start on the very first line (no blank lines before `---`).
- The `applyTo` value must be a quoted string.
- If the developer agent fails to run the code, check for ES module issues. You may need to add `"type": "module"` to a `package.json` or use `.mjs` extensions.
- For a deeper walkthrough, see [exercises/03-path-specific-instructions/README.md](exercises/03-path-specific-instructions/README.md).
